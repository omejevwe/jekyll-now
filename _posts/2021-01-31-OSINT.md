#### OSINT

Open source intelligence is a multi-methods methodology for collecting, analyzing and making decisions about data accessible in publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.> We loved with a love that was more than love

 In the intelligence community, the term ‘open’ refers to overt, publicly available sources.  We don’t have to interact with a person or a human to gather thus information. Do it passively from Google, social media, from websites from businesses. It’s all public information. 

Online identity is not who you are. Misrepresentation of somebody you are not. Sock puppet as a fake account, alternate identity, etc. the purpose of having a good sock puppet is to not draw attention back to yourself. The goal is never to let the person that we are looking into them. We are going to create a fake identity/person and this fake person might have a twitter account, might have a Gmail address or facebook and this should never tie back to you (IP address).

It should never be used on a device that links to your personal information, should never be used on a phone that ties to you. The purpose is to have an account that looks legitimate. That means creating content on this accounts, there should be some histories on these accounts. Make sure you are posting on the social media accounts. Establish more data to us so that we will look more legitimate. The main goal of the sock puppets is to do research and to try to investigate others.

### Search engine OSINT
Search your target name in all search engines. You can use www.Google.com, www.duckduckgo.com(it’s more of a private based engine), www.Bing.com, www.Yandex.com, www.Baidu.com
In Google to be more specific you can use wild cards and google hacking method and google advanced search to narrow down your search.

### **Reverse image searching**

To be able to identify people who are using pictures that aren’t theirs is really quite easy to do. Put their pictures in three different search engines to know what the result would be.
Take the image to Google page. It will identify the owner of the image. You can keep search by adding website to the search space. 

Top search is Google, Yandex, and www.TinEye.com.

Yandex will pick up similar picture related to the picture search. It’s useful when you are trying to hunt down somebody when doing investigation or looking for missing person. You can look at the similar picture that pops up to see if the person exist.

### Viewing EXIF data

EXIF is exchangeable image file and there is data that belongs to that. Provide lot of information. When you snap a picture there are data left behind that can be tied back to you. This is true for older days than now as there has been more protection these days. EXIF data can tell you exact location and exact devices, date that it was taken. This is concrete in an investigation.
Exif.regex.info/exif.cgi forviewing EXIF data
Pick a picture. You will see many details about the picture. Always use exif data for image investigation

### Physical location osint
Take satellite imaging to see if we can identify any useful information from looking at the satellite images. 

### Identifying geographical location
Using a picture to identify a geographical location. study the picture very well in details. Very peice of information even though it might look irrelevant is important and should be jotted down. As time goes information can be liked and tied together to make sense.

### Email OSINT

Find and verify email addresses. You can use for OSINT, sales, investigation work. You use it to find multiple lead in an organization. You have to figure out where the emails are from, who the email targets are. The website tools are www.Hunter.io, www.phonebook.cz, www.voilanorbert.com, and www.clearbit.

You can use this to look for information, and leads. Notice the pattern of the email address.  If I am looking for a specific person at a company then I will go to phonebook. When you take bunch of emails you will want to verify it, use tools.verifyemailaddress.io. Sometimes you can get false positive whether the email is good or bad. You can also use email-checker.net/validate. Forgot passwords from Google mail is very important.

### Password OSINT

When there is a breach there are lots of credentials that found in it. You can check the pattern of the password, to see if they have the same password pattern over and over again when there is more than one breach. The password can work somewhere else or the variation of the password can work somewhere else, if two email accounts have the same password.
To hunt down breach password you can use the following tools website;
Dehashed: This website we can search by email, username, IP address, name, address, and phonenumber. Take note of all the information and save them in a document and then relate the account to each other. Search if there are two same hash anywhere. Know who the password, people, and data are. You can also tie IP address to a location.Input the hash value to see if more than one email address is tied to it.

Other website tools are; www.hashes.org, www.weleakinfo, www.leakcheck.net, www.snusbase.com, www.haveibeenpwned.com. This websites will tell if a breach has happened and where.  Another website is www.scylla.com. It will say the domain that the leaked came from and there are collections of different passwords linked in breach on this one. This can be for attempted phishing emails.
