> We loved with a love that was more than love

Open source intelligence is a multi-methods methodology for collecting, analyzing and making decisions about data accessible in publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.> We loved with a love that was more than love

 In the intelligence community, the term ‘open’ refers to overt, publicly available sources.  We don’t have to interact with a person or a human to gather thus information. Do it passively from Google, social media, from websites from businesses. It’s all public information. 

Online identity is not who you are. Misrepresentation of somebody you are not. Sock puppet as a fake account, alternate identity, etc. the purpose of having a good sock puppet is to not draw attention back to yourself. The goal is never to let the person that we are looking into them. We are going to create a fake identity/person and this fake person might have a twitter account, might have a Gmail address or facebook and this should never tie back to you (IP address).

It should never be used on a device that links to your personal information, should never be used on a phone that ties to you. The purpose is to have an account that looks legitimate. That means creating content on this accounts, there should be some histories on these accounts. Make sure you are posting on the social media accounts. Establish more data to us so that we will look more legitimate. The main goal of the sock puppets is to do research and to try to investigate others.
